## Assignment 3.4: Scaffold with TopAppBar, BottomBar, and FAB

This app uses a scaffold to set up the basis of an app. There is a top app bar that incldues the title, a bottom bar with 3 navigation buttons (home, settings, and profile), and a floating action button that triggers a snackbar message. Additionally, there is content in the page that uses innerPadding to ensure that it does not overlap with other parts of the page. 

**Running the app:** Clone this repo in Android Studio and run an emulator
